Right before my mid-semester break, we were granted the opportunity to assemble a computer component.
One of the training's main attractions was learning about each of the different elements of a computer system. 

From the motherboard and CPU to the graphics card, RAM, and storage devices, 
I obtained a thorough understanding of how these components work together to form one integrated computer unit. 
The visual and sensory investigation of each component increased my respect for the complexity of today's computers.

In short, the PC assembly workshop was a transforming experience that not only provided me with practical skills 
but also increased my respect for the intricate details of computer technology. 
The knowledge obtained and difficulties faced during the class will undoubtedly influence my way of thinking 
about technology in the future.
