I previously attended a career development seminar given by bothÂ Encik Habib and a representative from PPG Company, 
which focused on managing the changing landscape of our particular professions and supporting personal and professional growth. 
The presentation left me with numerous major insights.

1. They highlighted the significance of ongoing education in today's fast-paced environment.
   The idea that remaining relevant demands dedication to continual education strikes an understanding with me.
2. Networking was another major theme. They also stressed the importance of making genuine connections and applying professional 
   connections for advancement in your career. The necessity of an established professional connection became increasingly obvious.
3. The presentation also discussed the importance of flexibility and endurance. 
   They presented experiences on overcoming obstacles and how adopting change may give rise to growth in both one's life and work.

The lessons offered by both distinguished speakers caused me to ponder on my own professional trajectory. 
I became aware that my comfort zone was limiting my advancement, and that I needed to go out 
and seek out fresh possibilities and challenges.
