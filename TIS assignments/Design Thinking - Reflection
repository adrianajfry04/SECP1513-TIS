The low-fidelity prototype created by fellow student during IT course has motivated me to consider 
the tangible influence of theoretical knowledge in practical application.

The student's prototype displayed not only technical abilities, 
but also a thorough awareness of user demands and the progressive nature of the design process. 
This experience has taught me the importance of experiential learning in IT education, 
which encourages students to interact directly with the tools and processes routinely used in industry. 

It serves as a reminder that, beyond theoretical debates, 
the ability to transfer ideas into actual prototypes is an essential talent for aspiring IT workers, 
bridging the gap between academic knowledge and practical skills.
