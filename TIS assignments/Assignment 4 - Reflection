Seeing major players in the IT sector like Huawei and Petronas was an eye-opening experience that went beyond the classroom. 
Experiencing these firms' dynamic work environments allowed me to see directly how the ideas we study in academia are 
used in real-world situations, in addition to showcasing their enormous scale and technological capability. 
Observing Petronas' assimilation of state-of-the-art technology for effective handling of resources and 
Huawei's inventiveness in networking and telecommunications gave me a profound understanding of the nexus between theory 
and practical application. 

The experience was a helpful reminder that academic undertakings shouldn't be pursued in a bubble; rather, 
they should aim to support and enhance the innovative and forward-thinking cultures of prominent members of the business.
